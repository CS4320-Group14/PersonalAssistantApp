PROGRAM RUN PROCEDURE

* Program can be run in Android Studio via the "Run..." or "Run 'my application'" option
  under Run in the main navigation bar

* Program should work for most emulations. For our own testing we used a Nexus 5 emulations

* Parts of our code were experiencing issues with the emulation run and are in the process of
  unit testing to better cypher issues. 
  
* Dummy values for day (which requires a string) and hour (which takes an integer) can be inputted
  for relevant methods in CurrentTime and DBMS for a disconnected run. 
  
* DBMS methods would also need an array of dummy values for seperate testing.
